# Scripts disabled due to outdated imports (not critical for production)
# These scripts reference old service files that were moved/renamed during MVP migration

sync-event-manual.ts           # References old src/services/sync.js
test-event-sync.ts             # References old src/database/repositories.js

# Re-enable by:
# 1. Update imports to use MVP services (e.g., src/services/mvp-rider-sync.service.js)
# 2. Update schema references to match prisma/schema.prisma (MVP schema)
# 3. Test locally before re-enabling

# Note: Core functionality (API, sync services) works via src/api/mvp-routes.ts
